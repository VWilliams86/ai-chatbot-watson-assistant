# IBM Watson AI Chatbot

## Overview
This project documents the design, training, and testing of an AI chatbot built using IBM Watson Assistant. The goal was to create a conversational AI capable of accurately responding to user queries through iterative training and refinement.

## Tools & Technologies
- IBM Watson Assistant
- IBM Cloud
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Intent and entity training
- Conversation flow design

## What I Built
- Designed chatbot conversation flows
- Created and labeled intents and training phrases
- Trained and tested the chatbot using Watson Assistant
- Improved response accuracy through iterative refinement
- Evaluated fallback responses and model limitations

## Use Case
The chatbot was designed to simulate a real-world AI assistant that can respond to user questions and guide users through predefined workflows.

## Results
- Improved intent recognition accuracy after training iterations
- Reduced fallback responses
- Successfully handled varied user input scenarios

## Key Learnings
- Importance of high-quality training data
- Limitations and bias risks in NLP models
- The need for human oversight in AI systems

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the chatbot interface, training data, and testing results are included in this repository.

## Future Improvements
- Expand intent coverage
- Integrate with external APIs
- Add monitoring and analytics
